# operators-ontology
This ontology provides a variety of operators designed for use with specifications that dictate that the value for some characteristic must be in some range. Two common use cases for these operators are: 
1. _Version dependencies_. For example, one ontology might depend on the version number of an imported ontology being in a certain range.
2. _Product specifications_. For example:
   1. A product specification for a lotion requires that the concentration of a toxin must be less than so many parts per billion.
   2. A product specification for a smartphone requires that the battery life is greater than so many hours.
